# Literature-site

**Project**
This is a web-site about literature that was a study project in Semos Academy course.
I used HTML and CSS to create a minimalistic and modern site with a information of books in 3 countries: Japan,Russia and Serbia and different periods.

A simple Home page with options that displayed on cover.
One of the page describing a book with information about author and a quote from the book as well as link to additional information.
On hover the background of the sections changed and picture slightly zoom in on hover.
