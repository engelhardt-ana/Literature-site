                    <h4>Requiem</h4>
                    <p>"I'd like to name all that I saw, but that's impossible."</p>
                    <p>"Requiem" is a powerful and poignant cycle of poems by the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, composed between 1935 and 1940 during the height of Stalin's purges and the Great Terror. The poem serves as a profound lamentation for the suffering and loss experienced by countless individuals, including Akhmatova herself, during this dark period in Soviet history.

                        Akhmatova's "Requiem" is a heartfelt and haunting exploration of the emotional and psychological toll of living under a totalitarian regime. The poems are marked by their stark and restrained language, conveying a sense of shared sorrow and resilience. They capture the anguish of waiting in long lines outside prisons, the uncertainty of loved ones' fates, and the endurance of hope amid despair. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_(Anna_Akhmatova)" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
