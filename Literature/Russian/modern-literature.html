            <div class="book">
                    <h4>Day of the Oprichnik</h4>
                    <p>"In Russia there is the idea that if you cannot eat it, then you have to eat it."</p>
                    <p>"Day of the Oprichnik" is a dystopian novel written by Russian author Vladimir Sorokin. Set in a futuristic Russia, the story unfolds in a single day and revolves around the life of Andrei Danilovich Komiaga, an oprichnik, a member of the modern-day secret police force reminiscent of the historical oprichnina of Ivan the Terrible's reign.

                        Sorokin's narrative is a satirical and surreal exploration of a totalitarian regime where brutality, corruption, and moral decay run rampant. The novel offers a scathing critique of contemporary Russian politics and society, while also drawing parallels to historical events. Through its darkly humorous and often grotesque portrayal of the protagonist's activities, "Day of the Oprichnik" serves as a thought-provoking commentary on power, loyalty, and the erosion of individual freedom in an authoritarian state. It challenges readers to reflect on the consequences of unchecked authority and the erosion of ethical values. <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Oprichnik" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
