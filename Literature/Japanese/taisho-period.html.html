                <h4>Rashomon and Other Stories</h4>

                    "Rashomon and Other Stories" is a collection of short stories by Japanese author Ryunosuke
                    Akutagawa,
                    originally published in the early 20th century. The title story, "Rashomon," is perhaps the most
                    famous in
                    the collection and explores the subjectivity of truth through multiple conflicting narratives of a
                    crime
                    witnessed at the Rashomon gate.

                    Akutagawa's stories are known for their psychological depth, exploration of moral ambiguity, and
                    rich
                    literary style. They often delve into themes of human frailty, existentialism, and the complexities
                    of human
                    nature. "Rashomon and Other Stories" is a thought-provoking work that challenges the reader's
                    perceptions of
                    truth and morality, and it continues to be a significant contribution to Japanese literature.
                    Akutagawa's
                    storytelling prowess and philosophical insights make this collection a classic in the realm of world
                    literature.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_and_Other_Stories"

                <h4>Midaregami (Disheveled Hair)</h4>
                <p>"Love in the mind of a woman is like the tide, it comes and goes."</p>
                <p>"Midaregami" or "Disheveled Hair" is a collection of poems by the Japanese author Akiko Yosano,
                    originally
                    published in 1901. Akiko Yosano is renowned for her innovative and bold approach to poetry,
                    particularly
                    tanka and modernist styles. In "Midaregami," she broke away from traditional literary conventions
                    and
                    societal norms, expressing her own thoughts and desires as a woman during a time when women's voices
                    were
                    often marginalized.

                    The poems in "Midaregami" are deeply personal and intimate, often exploring themes of love, desire,
                    and
                    sensuality. Yosano's writing is marked by its frankness and emotional intensity, challenging the
                    prevailing
                    norms of her era. Through her verse, she provided a unique perspective on the inner world of a
                    woman's
                    emotions and desires. "Midaregami" stands as a groundbreaking work in Japanese literature,
                    celebrated for
                    its courage and honesty in addressing topics considered taboo in its time, and it continues to be
                    influential in contemporary poetry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midaregami"
