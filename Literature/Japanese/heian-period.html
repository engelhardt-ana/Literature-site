            <span> <b>Summary</b>
                The work is a unique depiction of the lifestyles of high courtiers during the Heian period. It is
                written in archaic language and a poetic and complex style that make it unreadable without specialized
                study.[2] It was not until the early 20th century that Genji was translated into modern Japanese by the
                poet Akiko Yosano. The first English translation of Genji was attempted in 1882 by Suematsu Kencho, but
                was of poor quality and left incomplete.

            <h4>Diary of Lady Murasaki</h4>
            <p>"Life passes as swiftly as a dream."</p>
            <p>Autobiographical writings by Murasaki Shikibu.It is written in kana, then a newly-developed writing
                system for vernacular Japanese, more common among women, who were generally unschooled in Chinese.
                Unlike modern diaries or journals, 10th-century Heian diaries tend to emphasize important events more
                than ordinary day-to-day life and do not follow a strict chronological order. The work includes
                vignettes, waka poems, and an epistolary section written in the form of a long letter. <a

            <h4>The Pillow Book</h4>
            <p>"Things that make one's heart beat faster."</p>
            <p>A collection of essays and lists by Sei Shonagon.The work is a collection of essays, anecdotes, poems,
                and descriptive passages which have little connection to one another except for the fact they are ideas
                and whims of Shōnagon's spurred by moments in her daily life. In it she included lists of all kinds,
                personal thoughts, interesting events in court, poetry, and some opinions on her contemporaries. While
                it is mostly a personal work, Shōnagon's writing and poetic skill makes it interesting as a work of
                literature, and it is valuable as a historical document. <a
