                    <h4>The Bridge on the Drina</h4>
                    <p>"A bridge is like a monument. It carries the living history of its builders and passengers; of those who had good reason to cross it every day and those who had no reason to cross it at all; of those who did not notice it; and of those who waited a lifetime to see it. It is a silent witness to the lives of many generations, to people of the same and different faiths, professions, and ages."</p>
